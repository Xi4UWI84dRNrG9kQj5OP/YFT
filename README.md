Rust implementation of something based on Dan Willards [Y-fast-tries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020019083900753?via%3Dihub) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-fast_trie)) made with Ideas from [LS11 Inforamtik Tu-Dortmund](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/start).

For Usage Docu run with -h (don't forget -- on running with cargo).
